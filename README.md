An in-app purchase (or IAP) allows developers to charge users for specific functionality or content while using an app. 

Implementing IAPs is particularly compelling for several reasons:

- It’s an extra way to earn money, in addition to simply selling the app for a fee upfront. Some users are willing to spend a lot more on extra content or features.
- An app can be offered for free, which makes it a no-brainer download for most people. Free apps will typically get many more downloads than paid apps. If users enjoy the app, then they can purchase more content or functionality later.
- You can display advertisements to the user in a free app with an option to remove them by purchasing an IAP.
- Following the initial release of an app, new paid content can be added to the same app instead of having to develop a brand new app to earn more money.

In this in-app purchase tutorial, you’ll leverage IAPs to unlock extra content embedded in an app.
